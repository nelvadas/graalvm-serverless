# Going Serverless with GraalVM
Accelerating and Simplifying Serverless Application Development with  GraalVM Universal Virtual Machine

## Overview
 GraalVM Enterprise Native Image helps modernize applications by compiling  bytecode ahead-of-time to generate smaller, standalone executables. As a result, microservices run more efficiently, start without warming up, and use significantly fewer memory resources.
In this workshop, developers can access practice labs to build Serverless applications with GraalVM Enterprise. You will cover the following topics.

* Learn how to install GraalVM and Serverless Tools
*  Learn how Native Image generates smaller executables
*  Build native Java functions that perform more efficiently
*  Develop multi-cloud Serverless applications that work with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Functions (OCI Functions), Lambda, Azure Functions, etc.
*  Deploy GraalVM based functions on OCI and other cloud platforms
